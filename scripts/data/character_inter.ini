# Castaway
[character_1]
welcomes_girl = "<c:castaway:1> You slept through a raid? Lucky... When the goblins came for my ship, all I could do was panic and jump in a transporter. You'll be safer with us."
regression_test = "working!"
welcomes_traveller = "<c:castaway:1> Another transporter refugee! I ended up the same way... though I'm still not sure if jumping blindly into one was brave or just lucky..."

# Other Castaway
[character_27]
welcomes_girl = "<c:castaway:27> Your village showed more spine than my old crew. They threw me overboard rather than face the raiders. At least here, we stick together!"
welcomes_explorer = "<c:castaway:27> Mapping the skies? Good. The more we know about what's out there, the better we can fight back. Good to have you aboard!"

# Girl from burning island
[character_14]
welcomes_castaway_1 = "<c:girl:14> Another survivor! I know how it feels... the crew here helped me after I lost my village. You're in good hands!"
welcomes_castaway_2 = "<c:girl:14> Another survivor! I know how it feels... the crew here helped me after I lost my village. You're in good hands!"
welcomes_warrior_princess = "<c:girl:14> (aside: The warrior princess is so cool! <B:0> Someday I want to be like her...)"

# Explorer
[character_22]
welcomes_warrior_princess = "<c:explorer:22> A royal mission to secure ancient weapons? I've never even charted this location before, how exciting!"
