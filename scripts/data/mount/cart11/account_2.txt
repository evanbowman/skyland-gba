The human pirate called 

"Redbeard" thinksss he is sso 

clever.


The humansss tell storiesss 

of his "great raid" on our 

fortress. They make it sssound 

like he is some kind of hero.


Here is what actually 

happened:


Redbeard was prowling near our 

territory, looking for easy 

targets. We spotted him first. 

Our fortress was well-defended 

-he only got in because we 

were busy with other raids.


The human captivesss? They 

were more trouble than they 

were worth. Always whining, 

always eating our food. When 

Redbeard showed up, we 

thought: let him take them! 

Good riddance!


He fought his way through our 

halls, yesss. But most of our 

crew was out raiding that day. 

The ones who stayed? Young 

onesss, inexperienced. Of 

course they scattered!


And the "treasure" he took? 

Hah! Mostly coin we'd looted 

from merchant ships. Nothing 

special. The really valuable 

stuff; the weapons, the good 

salvage; we'd already moved to 

safer storage.


Now we hear Redbeard is nearly 

broke. Spent everything fixing 

his ship, paying his crew, 

buying supplies. Meanwhile, we 

continue our raids, filling 

our vaults.


The humans think he beat us? 

We let him WIN. A small loss 

to teach him that goblin 

territory is dangerous. Next 

time he'll think twice before 

coming near our fortresses.
