CHRONICLES OF SKY PEOPLES


Human Account - Compiler 

Unknown



In the early years following 

the Great Ascension, when 

humanity yet struggled to 

master the unforgiving skies, 

there arose a figure whose 

name still echoes in tavern 

tales and whispered warnings: 

Redbeard, the Crimson Terror, 

scourge of the high winds.


"...and thus the crimson-

bearded terror laid waste to 

seventeen fortresses in a 

single fortnight, his fearsome 

red beard striking terror into 

all who beheld it. Though 

Master Garrett of the Archives 

maintains the beard was more 

of a reddish-blonde, or 

perhaps strawberry in certain 

lights, and objects 

strenuously to the appellation 

'Redbeard' as historically 

inaccurate..."

-- Contemporaneous account


Among his most infamous 

exploits was the assault upon 

the goblin stronghold known 

variously as Skarn's Hold or 

the Fanged Citadel. The 

fortress had grown fat on 

plunder, its vaults swollen 

with merchant goods and, most 

grievously, captive humans.


Whether Redbeard struck from 

righteous fury or calculated 

greed, none can say. Some 

claim he sought vengeance for 

lost crew. Others whisper he'd 

been promised vast payment. 

Likely both tales hold truth.


The assault itself defies 

belief. Chronicles speak of 

his fortress approaching 

through storm clouds, emerging 

like a phantom from the mist. 

His cannons roared-some say 

for three hours without cease, 

though this seems improbable. 

The goblin defenders scattered 

before his advance.


Redbeard himself led the 

boarding party. He fought to 

the dungeons where the 

captives languished. One 

survivor claimed he felled 

thirty raiders in the central 

hall alone, though whether 

through superior swordsmanship 

or goblin incompetence remains 

unclear.


The captives were freed. 

Seventeen souls, by most 

accounts. Here the tale grows 

uncomfortable, for Redbeard 

did not simply return these 

unfortunates to their homes.


He sent word to their 

settlements: a ransom, though 

he named it "recovery fee" and 

"compensation for services 

rendered." Those families who 

could pay saw their loved ones 

returned. Those who could 

not... well, Redbeard was not 

entirely heartless. He put 

them to work aboard his 

fortress until payment could 

be arranged. In truth, he

treated them no worse than his

own crew.


"Hostages with extra steps," 

as one writer acidly observed.


The goblin fortress, stripped 

of wealth and weapons, was 

left to drift. What remains 

certain is that its survivors 

fled, carrying tales of the 

bearded devil who had humbled 

them.


And thus the skies knew both 

relief and unease. The goblins 

had learned to fear Redbeard's 

wrath, yes-but so too had 

honest merchants and peaceful 

settlements. In the lawless 

expanse of the early sky-

world, perhaps this was the 

only justice possible: a 

terror that preyed upon all 

with a certain terrible 

equality.
